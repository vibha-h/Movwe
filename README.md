# Movwe

Currently an alpha prototype... More UI improvements and features to come

Movwe is a movie app used to help groups of friends decide which movie to watch. Users form "lobbies", and add their favorite movies to the lobby's movie list. After finalizing the movie list, users can then personally rank the movies in order of preference. After each user in a lobby has ranked the movies, a "final rankings" list will be generated to determine which movie the group should watch.
